<h3>Import Targets</h3>

  Upload a .csv to import targets in bulk.
  <br><br>
  Each .csv <em>must</em> include the following three columns (case-insensitive):
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>name</b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>ra</b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>dec</b>
    </li>
  </ul>


  Two additional columns can also be added: <b>type</b> and <b>groups</b> (case-insensitive).
  <!-- <br><br> -->
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>type</b> is either 'SIDEREAL' or 'NON_SIDEREAL' (i.e. Extrasolar and Solar-System objects, respectively). If this column isn't present, each source is set to 'SIDEREAL'.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>groups</b> states whether a source is 'Public' (can be seen by everyone) or 'Private' (can only be seen by you and the admin). If this column isn't present, each source is set to 'Public'.
    </li>
  </ul>

  Additional columns parsed by GEMTOM can be found <a href="https://tom-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/tom_targets/models.html">here</a>.
  <br><br>

  Any other columns in your file will be added to the source as tags.

  <!-- Additional columns will be checked against your
  <a href="https://tom-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/targets/target_fields.html">EXTRA_FIELDS</a> and added if relevant.
  <hr>
  You can include a list of groups in an optional "groups" column to add targets to permission groups.
  These permission groups are different from target lists and will be used for determining which users can view the target.
  If the group does not exist, it will be ignored. -->
