<h2>Coming Soon</h2>

A list of the main features that have been requested and I intend to work on.
<b>Feel free to give input or send me ideas!</b>
<br>
<br>
<ul>

        <h5>Merging of BlackPEARL and GEMTOM</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Taking all the functionality of BlackPEARL and placing it into GEMTOM. This should hopefully streamline the process of object identification and categorisation!</li>
        </ul>

    <br>

        <h5>Cutouts</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Reference/difference images for each detection.</li>
        </ul>

    <br>

        <h5>'History' Page</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Expand the status page to more objects of other types.<br>
            Note: <b>This is where you come in!</b> If you have any codes that can comb the recent
            transients for any signals, pass them my way, and I can feature the results on GEMTOM.</li>
            <li>Note which targets are Gravitational Wave triggers.</li>
            <li>Have different messages on Night views that are in the future.</li>
            <li>Create a page for a full history archive.</li>
            <li>Maybe have the HR diagram show a list of historical BlackGEM transients too...?</li>
            <li>Add a way to distinguish old/new targets on the HR diagram</li>
        </ul>
    <br>

        <h5>Observation Tracker</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Include cutouts of each field</li>
            <li>Include a way to edit targets</li>
            <li>Automatically remove targets once in the past (but maybe keep in database?)</li>
        </ul>
    <br>


        <h5>Orphaned Transients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Find way to update the stats of the rated transients in the database (e.g. qui_num, maximum mag)</li>
            <li>Create some way to browse all unrated transients</li>
            <li>Get the Detections on Sky plot on the Orphaned Transients page</li>
            <li>Improve the SQL query finding the Orphaned Transients</li>
        </ul>
    <br>

<h4>GEMTOM v0.2.1 - Beyond BlackGEM; Telescopes</h4>
<br>
<ul>
    <h5>New Features</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><h6>Telescope Time!</h6></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In addition to the observation page in the last update, the 'ToOs' page has been revamped into the 'Telescope Time' page.</li>
            <li>Here, for any observations you have or are a part of, you can create a new observation block.</li>
            <li>When creating a target, you can assign an observation to that block - whether you schedule it from the Observation or Target page!</li>
            <li>Altitude graphs are calculated for any target assigned to a block with a valid location.</li>
            <!-- <li></li> -->
            <!-- <li></li> -->
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><h6>Miscellaneous features</h6></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Observations can now be filtered by observation block as well as day.</li>
            <li>Targets do not need to be assigned to any one date; if no date is inputted, they are set as 'Any' date and will show up under any date within their run. Altitude graphs will be made corresponding to the first day of their assigned run.</li>
            <li>Transients: Added a 'First Observed' date to the Recent Transients table<br>(Note that 'Last Obs' is only updated when it's added to the table, so can be outdated)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h5>Bugfixes</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Solved a bug in the Import Targets function; GEMTOM can now remove spaces in headers.</li>
        <li>Adjusted the create-target form to handle larger names for observation blocks and such.</li>
        <li>Solved a bug where NOT and Mookodi spectra couldn't be uploaded. If you want to upload spectra from other telescopes, let me know!</li>
        <li>Transients: Removed duplicate sources in the Recent Transients table.</li>
        <li>Transients: Solved the 'Last Obs' column in the Recent Transients table referring to the night of, rather than the date; it now corresponds to the time of the most recent point.</li>
        <li>Transients: Solved the 'Last Obs' column in the Recent Transients table not updating when new observations come in</li>
        <li>Transients: Solved new blank columns in the 'Recent Transients' table</li>
        <li>Targets: Made sure that, when a source is uploaded with its TNS name, that name is assigned to the 'TNS ID' field.</li>
        <li>Targets: Pages now link to TNS, if TNS ID is set.</li>
        <!-- <li></li> -->
    </ul>
</ul>

<div style="color:lightgrey">---------------------------------------</div>
<h4>GEMTOM v0.2 - Beyond BlackGEM; Observations</h4>
<br>
<ul>
    <h5>New Features</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><h6>Observation Tracker!</h6></li>
        <ul>
            <li>You can now access the Observations tab, which tracks all targets submitted for an observation!</li>
            <li>These can be added from the Observations page itself, or from a Target's page under the 'Overview' tab.</li>
            <li>Each observation auto-generates an altitude plot for the night selected. <s>While this feature is in beta, this is just for the NOT (La Palma).</s> Update: Altitude graphs are now produced based on selected location!</li>
            <li>You can delete targets with the red '✗' button.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h5>Bugfixes</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Targets/Transients: Solved ALADIN searches failing if the target had a positive declination</li>
        <li>Observation Tracker: Solved the page resetting to 'all' observations (from just those of a set date) each time a target is marked as observed/unobserved</li>
        <li>Transients: Solved several blank columns in the 'Recent Transients' table</li>
        <li>Transients: Solved some target information just not appearing when selected in the 'Recent Transients' table</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<br>
<div style="color:lightgrey">---------------------------------------</div>
<h4>GEMTOM v0.1.3 - Orphans</h4>
<br>
<ul>
    <h5>New Features</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><h6>Orphaned Transients!</h6></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The nightly transients page now contains a list of orphaned transients found that night, and links to their relevant GEMTOM pages.</li>
            <li>BlackGEM is queried for new orphaned transients every day (at 10, 12, and 14 UT).</li>
            <li>These transients are continuously fed through a Random Forest classifier, based on the user-submitted notes. This generates a Real/Bogus score specifically made for orphaned sources.</li>
            <li>You can label orphaned transients as interesting or not ('Yes' or 'No'), along with writing custom notes; this is only saved in GEMTOM, and doesn't communicate elsewhere.</li>
            <li>GEMTOM also searches its own records for past notes, so if an orphaned transient has already been noted to be a Diffraction Spike or a TNS source, that shows up on each night's page.</li>
            <li>All labelled Orphaned Transients are listed on a new Transients page. Orphans can also be reviewed and re-rated here.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><h6>Search by TNS, IAU Name, and Gaia DR3 Designation</h6></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Transients page now lets you search by TNS. The nearest target within 100 arcseconds is returned.<br>
                If present, you're redirected automatically to the nearest target within 2 arcseconds.</li>
            <li>You can also search by IAU Name (BGEM JXXX-XXX). This is a fuzzy search, which will return all objects roughly matching your query. If multiple targets match, a list will be returned.</li>
            <li>You can also search by Gaia DR3 Designation. If multiple targets match, a list will be returned, with their distances.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the Coordinate search has been edited to work like these alternative search methods, which avoids some bugs in the old method.</li>
            <li>Finally, you can now search for an RA and Dec, and find the last time those coordinates have been observed.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li><h6>Miscellaneous features</h6></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Targets can now be added to GEMTOM via a URL (/url_to_GEMTOM/[BlackGEM ID]), useful to adding from external tools.</li>
            <li>Word display limit has been removed on comments. Character count remains at 3000 (roughly 500 words, or an A4 page of text)</li>
            <li>Removed spurious 99-mag results from lightcurves</li>
            <li>Transients: Added non-detections to a 'Full Observation Data' table</li>
            <li>Transients: The 'TNS Object within 10 arcsecond' highlight now states whether BlackGEM data has been reported to TNS (it checks to see if 'BGEM' exists in the internal name)</li>
            <li>Targets/Transients: Added link to BlackPEARL</li>
            <li>Targets/Transients: Added link to search Vizier</li>
            <li>Targets/Transients: Added link to search Aladin, which includes DESI Legacy DR10 and DECAPS DR2</li>
            <li>Targets/Transients: Reduced SIMBAD search from 2 to 1 arcminute</li>
            <li>Targets/Transients: Aladin inset now includes a 'Legacy DR10 Color' option (Thanks Hugo!)</li>
            <li>Targets: Removed fields related to observations, which have not been set up.</li>
            <li>Targets: BlackGEM Data Points now show uncertainties.</li>
            <li>History: Nightly pages now have tabs for Orphaned, Gaia, and Extragalactic transients.</li>
            <li>Meta: When 'Add the GEMTOM' is clicked, a message is now delivered (either that the target has been created, or already exists), and GEMTOM redirects to the new target's page.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Bugfixes</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>If GEMTOM cannot connect to the Transient server, it should now serve an error message instead of crashing.</li>
        <li>Transients: Flipped the x-axis in the 'Location on Sky' plot, in order to match the Aladin view.</li>
        <li>Transients: Removed the 'Flux' columns from the 'Full Observation Data' table (unnecessarily made the table bigger). Also removed the ability to edit the cells.</li>
        <li>Transients: Fixed a bug where the 10 arcsecond circle in the 'Location on Sky' plot would span the sky if the targets lay within 5 arcseconds of RA 0.</li>
        <li>Transients: Fixed a bug where, if multiple TNS sources were within 10 arcseconds, the nearest one was not highlighted at the top of the page.</li>
        <li>Lightcurves: Fixed the x axis so that it plots decimals of MJDs.</li>
        <li>Live Feed: Fixed a bug that occurred if there was no limiting magnitude data for a transient ID.</li>
        <li>History: Blank Sky Plot no longer made when there is no connection to BlackHub; system instead reports lack of connection.</li>
        <li>History: Fixed a bug where nightly pages wouldn't appear if there are no detections</li>
        <li>History: Fixed another bug where nightly pages would crash if there are no detections</li>
        <li>History: Corrected the all-sky plot that's displayed when there's no data (it now fits with all other plots)</li>
        <li>History: Massively sped up the creation of the sky plot and field stats;
            when a page is loaded, these will be re-created/found each time, up until 12:00UT of the following day.
            After that, a final version will be created and saved, and from that point on, that version will be used.
            Pages in the future also no longer look for field stats, and use a pre-saved empty version of the sky plot.</li>
        <li>History: Sped up the plotting of the HR diagram.
            The main bottleneck was in the Mag Diff slider; this has now been reduced to only a few options.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
