<h2>Coming Soon</h2>

A list of the main features that have been requested and I intend to work on.
Feel free to give input or send me ideas!
<br>
<br>
<ul>

    <li>
        <h5>Server</h5>
        Biggest goal right now - launching this into production for all of you to play with!
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <h5>ToO Page</h5>
        A page for inputting your ToO time on different telescopes. Could have a python-created
        timetable showing start and stop times. Input requested here - what would make this
        useful for you?
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <h5>Cutouts</h5>
        Reference/difference images for each detection.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        <h5>Expanded 'History' Page</h5>
        Expand the status page to include objects of other types, not just Extragalactic.<br>
        Note: <b>This is where you come in!</b> If you have any codes that can comb the recent
        transients for any signals, pass them my way, and I can feature the results on GEMTOM.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        <h5>Improved 'Target' Page</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Add filters to the BlackGEM data</li>
            <li>Link to the GEMTOM/BlackView pages for each source.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
